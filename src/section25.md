# DART Tutorial Section 25:  
### A Simple 1D Advection Model: Tracer Data Assimilation  

---

### 1D Simple Advection Model: Overview

1. One-dimensional periodic domain.
2. Chaotic/stochastic model for wind.
3. A single passive tracer is advected by the wind.
4. A stochastic model for tracer source can be added.
5. A diurnal cycle for the tracer source can be added.
6. A model for phase offset of the diurnal cycle can also be added.

This model can be found in `models/simple_advection` and configured in the `work` directory.

---

### 1D Simple Advection Model Details

- **Domain**: One-dimensional periodic grid on the domain \([0, 1]\).
- **Grid**: Equally spaced grid points, controlled by `num_grid_points` in the namelist.
- **Time-stepping**: Controlled by `time_step_days` and `time_step_seconds`.

---

### The Wind Model: Burgerâ€™s Equation

The wind equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
$$

- The continuous solution can form shocks when \( u \) varies with \( x \).
- **Upstream Lagrangian differencing** is used to avoid forming shocks.
- Heavy damping ensures that the model generally avoids shocks.

---

### Wind Model Namelist Controls

1. Random perturbations are applied to the wind field at every timestep:  
   $$
   u_i = u_i + \text{Normal}(0, W \Delta t)
   $$
   - **`wind_random_amp`** controls the magnitude of random perturbations.
   
2. The mean wind field is damped to a spatial mean \( M \):  
   $$
   u(t + \Delta t) = u(t) - WD \Delta t \left(u(t) - M\right)
   $$
   - **`wind_damping_rate`** and **`mean_wind`** control the damping and mean wind values.

---

### Tracer Field and Namelist Controls

- A single passive tracer is advected by the wind.
- The tracer concentration \\( C_i \\) at each grid point evolves with time:
  $$
  C_i = C_i + S_i \Delta t - D \Delta t C_i
  $$
  - \\( S_i \\): Tracer source/sink rate.
  - \\( D \\): Tracer destruction rate, controlled by **`destruction_rate`**.

---

### Example Assimilation Experiment

1. **Observations**:
   - 10 equally spaced observations of wind \\( u \\) and tracer concentration \\( C \\).
   - Located between grid points (e.g., 0.05, 0.15, ..., 0.95).
   - Observation errors: \\( \text{var}(u) = 16.01 \), \( \text{var}(C) = 1000.2 \\).
   
2. **Experiment**:
   - Run `./perfect_model_obs` followed by `./filter`.
   - Analyze behavior using Matlab and track errors in concentration and wind fields.

---

### Experiment Variations

1. Modify the types of observations being assimilated by changing the namelist settings in `&obs_kind_nml`:
   - For example, only assimilate wind observations or only tracer concentration observations.

2. Explore the impact of using fewer observations or no observations, and understand the results.

---

### Tracer Source Model

- The tracer source can evolve as a damped random walk at each grid point:
  $$
  S_i = S_i + \text{Normal}(0, SR) - SD (S_i - \bar{S_i})
  $$
  - **`source_random_amp_frac`** controls the random noise amplitude.
  - **`source_damping_rate`** controls the damping rate.

---

### Diurnal Component for Tracer Source

- The diurnal cycle can be added using the **`source_diurnal_rel_amp`** parameter.
- The amplitude of the diurnal component is set as a fraction of the source value.

---

### Problems to Explore

1. **Observation Costs**:  
   Design an optimal observing/assimilation system with a limited budget for observations. Try different configurations to minimize total error for tracer concentration or source estimation.
   
2. **Sparse Observations**:  
   Investigate the effects of reducing the number of observations or changing observation frequency.

3. **Tracer Creation and Destruction**:  
   Analyze if the assimilation process creates or destroys tracer, and try to minimize this effect.
