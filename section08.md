### Dealing with Sampling Error

### Updating Additional Prior State Variables

Two primary sources of error:

1. **Sampling error due to noise**:  
   - Even with a linear relationship between variables, sample regression coefficients can be imprecise with finite ensembles.
  
2. **Linear approximation invalid**:  
   - Nonlinearity in the true relationship between variables may require special handling, especially over a large range of prior ensemble.

### Regression Sampling Error & Filter Divergence

- **Scenario**: The unobserved state variable is known to be unrelated to the observed variables.
- **Problem**: Even with finite samples, non-zero correlations are observed, leading to incorrect adjustments of the unobserved variable.
  - The unobserved variable mean may follow a random walk as more observations are used.
  - The standard deviation (SD) of the unobserved variable tends to decrease, which leads to overconfidence in the estimates.
  
---

### Filter Divergence

- **Issue**: Overconfidence in unobserved variables results in ignoring meaningful observations.
- **Example**: In the Lorenz 96 experiment, filter spread became small, giving the filter the illusion of a good estimate. However, the error remained large because good observations were ignored.

### Dealing with Regression Sampling Error

#### Strategies:
1. **Ignore it**:  
   - If the number of unrelated observations is small and variance is maintained in priors (e.g., in 3 and 9 variable models).

2. **Use larger ensembles**:  
   - Increasing ensemble size reduces sampling error but can become expensive for large problems.
   - Try different ensemble sizes by modifying `ens_size` in `&filter_nml` (e.g., 40, 80, 160).

3. **Use a priori information**:  
   - Incorporate knowledge about the relationships between observations and state variables (e.g., use localization).

4. **Correct for sampling error**:  
   - DART provides several methods to estimate and correct for sampling error.

### Localization in DART

- **Localization** refers to weighting regression based on the distance between observations and state variables.
  - DART provides different shapes for the localization function, controlled by `select_localization` in `&cov_cutoff_nml`.
  - The **half-width** of the localization function is set by `cutoff` in `&assim_tools_nml`.

#### Localization Options:
- 1: Gaspari-Cohn
- 2: Boxcar
- 3: Ramped Boxcar

### Experimenting with Lorenz 96

- Test different localization half-widths for the Lorenz 96 model using a 40-member ensemble.
  ```bash
  cd models/lorenz_96/work
  ./workshop_setup.sh
  ```
- **Exercise**: Explore different localization settings and assess their impact on the results.

### Spread Restoration

- DART implements a **spread restoration** algorithm:
  - After computing increments from an observation, if no correlation is expected, compute the expected decrease in spread and add it back.
  - Enable this algorithm by setting `spread_restoration = .true.` in `&assim_tools_nml`.

---

### Sampling Error Correction

- DART also provides a **sampling error correction** algorithm, which reduces but doesnâ€™t entirely eliminate issues. It often improves results for large models.
  - Enable this algorithm by setting `sampling_error_correction = .true.` in `&assim_tools_nml`.
