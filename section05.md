# DART Tutorial Section 5:  
### Comprehensive Filtering Theory: Non-Identity Observations and the Joint Phase Space  

---

### Dynamical System Overview
- The system is governed by a stochastic difference equation:  
  \( dxt = f(xt, t) + G(xt, t)d\beta t, \, t \geq 0 \)

- Observations are made at discrete times:  
  \( yk = h(xk, tk) + vk; \, k = 1,2,...; \, tk+1 > tk \geq t0 \)  
  \( vk \sim N(0, Rk) \)

- The goal is to find the probability distribution for the state at time \( t \):  
  \( p(x,t | Yt) \)

---

### A General Context for Filtering with Geophysical Models

1. **State between observations** is obtained from the difference equation.
2. **Update state** given new observations using Bayesâ€™ rule:
   \[
   p(x, tk | Ytk) = \frac{p(yk | xk, Ytk-1) p(x, tk | Ytk-1)}{p(yk | Ytk-1)}
   \]

3. **Normalizing denominator** involves integrating the numerator:
   \[
   p(yk | Ytk-1) = \int p(yk | x) p(x, tk | Ytk-1) dx
   \]

4. **Extend the state vector** to a joint state-observation vector \( z = [x, y] \), ensuring we have a prior for each observation.

### Dealing with Many Observations
- Observations may be split into subsets \( yk = \{yk^1, yk^2, ..., yk^s\} \).
- Observational errors in set \( i \) are independent from those in set \( j \).
- Assimilation can be done sequentially for these subsets:
  \[
  p(yk | z) = \prod_{i=1}^{s} p(yk^i | z)
  \]

#### Options for Non-Scalar Observations:
1. Use matrix algebra to repeat the derivation.
2. Apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to diagonalize the observation error covariance matrix, then assimilate in the rotated space.

Good news: Most geophysical observations have independent errors!

### How an Ensemble Filter Works for Geophysical Data Assimilation

1. **Advance ensemble to the next observation time** using the model.
2. **Obtain a prior sample of the observation** by applying the forward operator \( h(x) \) to each ensemble member.
3. **Get observed value and error distribution** from the observing system.
4. **Compute increments** for the prior observation ensemble.
5. **Linearly regress observation increments** onto state variable increments for each state variable.
6. **Update all ensemble members** to get a new analysis, then integrate forward to the next observation time.

### Non-Identity Observation Operators in Lorenz 63

- Try observing means of variables \( (x, y) \), \( (y, z) \), and \( (z, x) \) using the input file `obs_seq.out.average`.
- Same error variance and observation frequency as in previous cases.
- Modify `input.nml` in `models/lorenz_63/work`:
  ```fortran
  &filter_nml
  obs_sequence_in_name = "obs_seq.out.z"
  ```
- Execute the `filter` program and compare error statistics and time series to the identity case.
  
Results:  
- Errors are much larger!  
- Identity observations remove all regression error, but this can be misleading.
