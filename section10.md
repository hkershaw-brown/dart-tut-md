### Regression and Non-Linear Effects

### Updating Additional Prior State Variables

Two primary sources of error:

1. **Invalid linear approximation**:  
   - Nonlinearity in the true relationship between variables.
   
2. **Sampling error due to noise**:  
   - Even if the relationship is linear, sample regression coefficients may be imprecise.

### Nonlinear Relations Between Variables: Sorting Increments

- **Scenario**:  
  The prior sample has no noise, but the relationship between observed and unobserved variables is non-linear.
  
- **Solution**:  
  Minimize increments by sorting the prior and posterior samples and pairing them accordingly. This reduces the regression error.

---

### Sorting Increments Impact

- Sorting has a significant impact, especially when posterior samples are selected by random algorithms.
  
- **Example**:  
  In the 9-variable model, try `filter_kind = 2` in `&assim_tools_nml` with `sort_obs_inc = .true.` and `sort_obs_inc = .false.` to observe the difference in noise levels.

### Sorting Increments in Lorenz 96

- Sorting increments can also be examined in the Lorenz 96 model.
  
- Try a case with no localization (large cutoff) and vary inflation with and without sorting.

---

### Nonlinear Relations: Local Regression

- When the prior sample is noisy and the unobserved-observed relationship is non-linear, performing global regression is problematic.
  
- **Solution**:  
  Local regression for points within the range of the update increment. This approach works better with larger ensembles.

---

### Local Regression Limitations

- As sample size decreases, error increases, except in cases where the sample was already highly erroneous.
  
- **Note**:  
  DART does not currently support local regression without code modification.
