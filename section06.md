# DART Tutorial Section 6:  
### Other Updates for an Observed Variable  

---

### Introduction

- When dealing with ensemble filters, the prior is treated as a finite sample.
- Assumption: this is a random draw from the ‘truth’.

---

### Product of Two Gaussians
- The probability update for an observed variable involves a product of two Gaussians.
- The prior distribution is fitted to a Gaussian to compute the posterior.

---

### Fitting a Continuous Distribution to the Sample
- Typically, observation likelihoods are continuous (often Gaussian).
- For non-Gaussian observation likelihoods, methods can be generalized (e.g., fitting Gaussian kernels).

---

### Sampling the Posterior Distribution
- Computing the posterior is straightforward when dealing with Gaussians, but sampling from the posterior distribution can be more complex.
- **Random sampling** is one method, controlled by `filter_kind=5` in the `&assim_tools_nml` namelist.
  
---

### Adjusting the Sample to Match Mean and Variance
- The mean and variance of the sample can be adjusted to match the exact values.
- Outliers can be eliminated, though this can lead to different sample properties.

---

### Constructing a Deterministic Sample
- A deterministic sample with exact mean, variance, and other features can be created.
- Adjusting kurtosis (e.g., setting `filter_kind=6` in `&assim_tools_nml`) helps in constructing such samples.

---

### Special Cases
- For bimodal priors, it’s important to retain information from the prior, as done in the **Ensemble Adjustment Filter (EAF)**.
  
---

### Ensemble Filter Algorithms

- **Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)**: 
  - A commonly used method where observations are ‘perturbed’ and associated with prior samples.

- **Ensemble Kernel Filter (EKF)**:
  - An alternative to the EnKF, which retains more information about non-Gaussian priors.

- **Rank Histogram Filter (RHF)**:
  - Handles non-Gaussian priors and observation likelihoods better than the EnKF.
  - Performs well with Gaussian priors and low-information-content observations.

---

### Particle Filter Algorithms
- **Particle Filter**: A classical method but impractical for high-dimensional atmospheric models.  
- DART provides a 1D particle filter, though inconsistencies between updates for different observations remain a challenge.

---

### Using DART Diagnostics
- Questions arise about the relative performance of different filter methods in the Lorenz 63 model.
- Some methods (e.g., kernel filters) may handle bimodal distributions better.
